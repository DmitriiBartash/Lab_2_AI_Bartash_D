# üîç Search Algorithms Playground

This repository contains educational implementations of classic graph search algorithms widely used in Artificial Intelligence (AI), pathfinding, and robotics.

## Algorithms Implemented

- **A\*** (A-Star Search)
- **BFS** (Breadth-First Search)
- **DFS** (Depth-First Search)
- **UCS** (Uniform Cost Search)
- **GBFS** (Greedy Best-First Search)
- **Bidirectional Search**

These algorithms are implemented from scratch and designed for experimentation and learning purposes.

## Why It Matters for AI

Search algorithms are fundamental in AI for solving problems where an agent must make decisions, plan paths, or find optimal solutions. They are essential in:

- Game AI (NPC navigation)
- Robotics (pathfinding in environments)
- Puzzle solving (e.g., 8-puzzle)
- Route optimization (e.g., logistics and transport)
- Planning systems

Each algorithm uses a different strategy:
- **BFS/DFS** explore the graph without cost or heuristic
- **UCS** finds the lowest-cost path
- **GBFS** uses heuristics to prioritize promising paths
- **A\*** balances cost and heuristic (optimal and efficient)
- **Bidirectional Search** accelerates finding paths by searching from both start and goal
